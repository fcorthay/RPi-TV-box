# RPi-TV-box
This repository provides scripts and information as how to use a Raspberry Pi as to record and watch Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) television programmes.

My main usage of this is to aquire Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) in order to allow me to choose the programmes I want to record.
The corresponding videos are stored on a local harddisk, ready to be watched.

This is a low-level approach as compared to the installation of [Tvheadend](https://tvheadend.org/p/about) and [Kodi](https://kodi.wiki).
It allows to easily script the actions and to access the recordings from other computers in the local network.
The TV programme or the recorded movies don't have to be watched on a screen attached to the RPi :
the device can be used as a standalone box providing the videos to other computers such as the one attached to the living room TV.

The [wiki](https://github.com/fcorthay/RPi-TV-box/wiki) shows how to install the system.
