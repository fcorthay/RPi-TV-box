This repository provides scripts and information as how to use a Raspberry Pi as to record and watch Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) television programmes.

My main usage of this is to aquire Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) in order to allow me to choose the programmes I want to record.
The corresponding videos are stored on a local harddisk, ready to be watched.

The [wiki](https://github.com/fcorthay/RPi-TV-box/wiki) shows how to install the system.
